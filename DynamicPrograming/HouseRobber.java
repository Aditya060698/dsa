/**
 * Problem:  -  #You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you 
 * from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on 
 * the same night.
 * Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 *
 * Approach:
 * - Recurrance Relation:-So basically in order find the max  loot till the point what will be rquired is tow option
 *   1.Either include the current house and calculate the max loot till n-2 house and add them up skipping n-1
 *   2. Or don't include the current house and calculate till the house before it maxLoot till n-1
 *  and max of them will give the max loot

     * üîπ Approach: 1.Memoization 
     *
     * üïí Time Complexity:O(n). Every house is computed only once.
     * üóÇÔ∏è Space Complexity: O(n). For recursion stack space and memo array.
     *
     * üîÅ Important Points:
     * 1. Using the recurrance relation calulating the max loot and storing the values in memo array
